# ShowCase

Showcase is a application i started working on to bring to life my love of art.
I myself am not a good artist or even near it, so i decided upon a feed stream 
platform, like facebook, except for where people can share their favorite 
pictures and open related art websites to browse and upload. 

included are all the important files and xcode project for recreation of the 
app, however this is still in its very early stages, and its functionality is 
still extremely limited. However it does open websites and show the basic design
of a feed.
